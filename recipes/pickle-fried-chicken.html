    <h1>Pickle Fried Chicken</h1>
    <img src="../images/pickle-fried-chicken.jpeg">
    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Pointedly low-fuss and remarkably moist, this recipe gets its verve from pickles used two ways: 
        Dill pickle brine seasons and moistens the chicken from the inside-out, while chopped pickles 
        add zip to the coleslaw. Many fried chicken sandwich recipes use breasts, but thighs have more 
        fat, which means they’re more flavorful and harder to overcook. The chicken also fries at a 
        lower temperature, so it finishes cooking and its crust crisps at precisely the same time. 
        The buttermilk is key to the crispness here, so avoid any substitutions. Paired with cornstarch, 
        it forms a thick crust that shatters with each bite.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul> 
        <li>4 (5 ounce) chicken thighs</li>
        <li> cups dill pickle juice</li>
        <li>1 cup vegetable oil for frying</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>¾ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place chicken thighs in a resealable plastic bag; cover with pickle juice. Seal and refrigerate for 3 hours.</li>
        <li>Drain pickle juice from thighs. Cover chicken; refrigerate until ready to fry.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Heat 2 inches oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Pour buttermilk and flour into 2 separate bowls. Season flour with salt and pepper. </li>
        <li>Dredge chicken in buttermilk. Toss in flour. Return to buttermilk and toss in flour a second time. </li>
        <li>Place chicken on a rack set over a baking sheet.</li>
        <li>ill Dutch oven with as many thighs as possible without crowding. Cook at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) until golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes per side.</li> 
        <li>Place thighs on the baking sheet. Repeat until all pieces are fried. Transfer thighs to the oven.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 5 to 8 minutes. </li>
        <li>An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Season with a pinch of salt.</li>
    </ol>
