    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Bread is a soft but dense sweet white bread made from a rich, 
        low-yeast dough. This dough will take its time to rise, 
        but it can be prepared up to 1 day in advance and slow-proofed in the refrigerator, 
        which will develop the dough’s flavor. This recipe fits a standard Pullman loaf pan, 
        so it makes a lot. Serve the bread in nice thick slices alongside some obe ata and 
        scrambled eggs, or butter and toast it to enjoy dunked into milk tea.</p>
